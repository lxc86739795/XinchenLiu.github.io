# Introduction to the MVP Dataset

We present a novel large-scale dataset, Multi-grained Vehicle Parsing (MVP), for semantic analysis of vehicles in the wild, which has several featured properties.

* The MVP contains 24,000 vehicle images captured in read-world surveillance scenes, which makes it more scalable for real applications.

* For different requirements, we annotate the vehicle images with pixel-level part masks in two granularities, i.e., the coarse annotations of ten classes and the fine annotations of 59 classes.
The former can be applied to object-level applications such as vehicle Re-Id, fine-grained classification, and pose estimation, while the latter can be explored for high-quality image generation and content manipulation.
The statistics of the dataset are as follows:

| Subset     | Class Number  |  Image Number  |
| :--------  | -----         | ----           |
| MVP-coarse | 10 (9 parts + background)            |   21000        |
| MVP-fine   | 59 (58 parts + background)           |   3000         |

* The images reflect complexity of real surveillance scenes, such as different viewpoints, illumination conditions, backgrounds, and etc.
In addition, the vehicles have diverse countries, types, brands, models, and colors, which makes the dataset more diverse and challenging.

# How to Get It

The vehicle images are sampled from three public datasets for vehicle re-identification, 
i.e., [VeRi](https://vehiclereid.github.io/VeRi/) [1], 
[AICITY19-ReID](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/) [2], and 
[VeRi-Wild](https://github.com/PKU-IMRE/VERI-Wild) [3].
**The original vehicle images should be obtained from the original owners of the three datasets.**

The MVP dataset provides only the vehicle parsing annotation and can be downloaded from: [Baidu Pan (download code: o7l2)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1T_dWJ0UwV47HZyf4ht_5Nw) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zTaTKCwj5s5DMue0y0TMkJUuH7oa_cmm/view?usp=sharing).
The code and vehicle parsing models trained on the MVP dataset can be directly used from this [repo](https://github.com/lxc86739795/human_vehicle_parsing_platform).

# Structure
The structure of the directory is organized as follows:

| SubDir                    | Description  |
| :--------                 | -----        |
| coarse_annotation         | coarse part annotation files            |
| coarse_visualization_RGB  | coarse part visualization files         |
| fine_annotation           | coarse part annotation files            |
| fine_visualization_RGB    | coarse part visualization files         |
| legend                    | legend files for visualization          |
| fine_index_list.txt       | each line shows the ['fine-grained annotation index' 'original dataset' 'original image name']|
| coarse_index_list.txt     | each line shows the ['coarse-grained annotation index' 'original dataset' 'original image name']|
