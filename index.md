## About Me
I am currently a researcher at JD AI Research working with Dr. [Wu Liu](https://liuwu.weebly.com/) and Dr. [Tao Mei](https://taomei.me/).
I received my Ph. D. degree in computer science in Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunication Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, in 2018. 
My supervisor is Prof. [Huadong Ma](https://int.bupt.edu.cn/content/content.php?p=2_4_266). 
My research interests include multimedia computing, computer vision, and their applications in retail.

## Datesets

### VeRi ([More Details](http://vehiclereid.github.io/VeRi/))
VeRi is a large-scale benchmark dateset for vehicle Re-Id in the real-world urban surveillance scenario.
It contains over 50,000 images of 776 vehicles captured by 20 cameras covering an 1.0 km^2 area in 24 hours.
The images are captured in a real-world unconstrained surveillance scene and labeled with varied attributes, e.g. BBoxes, types, colors, and brands.
Each vehicle is captured by 2 âˆ¼ 18 cameras in different viewpoints, illuminations, resolutions, and occlusions, which provides high recurrence rate for vehicle Re-Id in practical surveillance environment.
It is also labeled with sufficient license plates and spatiotemporal information, such as the BBoxes of plates, plate strings, the timestamps of vehicles, and the distances between neighbouring cameras.

### ViSR (Download from [BaiduPan (~57GB)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Rnk5oMJlLjAHi0vEgzqEWg))
ViSR si a large-scale and high-quality Video based Social Relation dataset.
It contains more than 8,000 video clips cropped from over 200 movies of various types.
It not only covers most common social relations in daily life with balanced class distribution, but also contains various scenes, environments, and backgrounds, which makes ViSR
a challenging dataset. 
the length of most clips is limited in 30 seconds to keep the stable scenes, which reduces the ambiguity of relations in videos.
